    "### Question:\n",
    "\n",
    "How is time invested, age/experience, associated with income? This is the question we wish to explore in this project. We will create a model that predicts the binary label of income (>50K or <=50K/year) based on age, education level, hours per week, and marital-status.  The data will help us to train a logistic regression model to predict income of a person given their answers for the explanatory variables. By using age/hours worked per week as a proxy for experience, we will use these variable to explain how predicted income may change with these variables. Marital status may be somewhat connected to age so using this variable with an interaction term may help to make the predictions better. Finally education level is how we will judge 'time invested' into an industry. This question is focused on prediction to see if we are able to accurately predict the income based on our given explanatory variables. "
